# Learning.md — What We Fixed & Why

This file explains every change made to the EventTicketingAPI project in simple terms.
Great for beginners who want to understand what went wrong and how it was fixed.

---

## 1. The Wrong MongoDB URL (`.env`)

**File:** `.env`

**What was wrong:**
The database connection URL was missing a part of the address. It looked like:
```
cluster0.mongodb.net
```
But the real address from MongoDB Atlas was:
```
cluster0.u6kzcmv.mongodb.net
```
That `u6kzcmv` part is a unique ID for your specific cluster. Without it, the app couldn't find the database — like trying to send a letter with an incomplete address.

**Fix:** Updated `MONGO_URI` in `.env` with the correct full address from MongoDB Atlas.

---

## 2. Code Running in the Wrong Order (`app.js`)

**File:** `app.js`

**What was wrong:**
In Node.js, `module.exports` is the line that says *"here is what I'm sharing with other files"*. The problem was that `module.exports = app` was placed in the middle of the file. The lines after it (registering routes and connecting to the database) still ran, but by the time `server.js` received the app, those things hadn't happened yet.

Think of it like handing someone a sandwich before you've added the filling.

**Fix:** Moved all `require()` calls to the top, called `connectDB()` and registered routes before `module.exports`, and put `module.exports = app` as the very last line.

**Correct order:**
```
1. require() all dependencies
2. dotenv.config()
3. create the app
4. connect to database
5. register routes
6. module.exports = app  ← always last
```

---

## 3. A Stray Letter Crashing the App (`eventController.js`)

**File:** `controllers/eventController.js`

**What was wrong:**
There was a random letter `s` at the very end of the file, making the last line look like `};s` instead of `};`. JavaScript didn't know what `s` meant and crashed with:
```
ReferenceError: s is not defined
```

**Fix:** Removed the stray `s`.

---

## 4. A Function Defined After It Was Exported (`eventController.js`)

**File:** `controllers/eventController.js`

**What was wrong:**
The `getEventStats` function was written *after* the `module.exports` line. This means it was never included in the exports. When `eventRoutes.js` tried to use it, it got `undefined` — causing a crash.

Think of it like putting items in a box, sealing it, and then trying to add more items. The extra items never make it in.

**Fix:** Moved `getEventStats` above `module.exports` and added it to the exports list:
```js
module.exports = { createEvent, getEvents, bookTicket, cancelTicket, validateTicket, getEventStats };
```

---

## 5. Missing Import in Routes (`eventRoutes.js`)

**File:** `routes/eventRoutes.js`

**What was wrong:**
`getEventStats` was being used in the routes file but was never imported. It's like trying to use a tool you never took out of the toolbox.

**Fix:** Added `getEventStats` to the destructured import at the top:
```js
const { createEvent, getEvents, bookTicket, cancelTicket, validateTicket, getEventStats } = require("../controllers/eventController");
```

---

## 6. No `.gitignore` File (Git Setup)

**File:** `.gitignore` *(newly created)*

**What was wrong:**
There was no `.gitignore` file, which means sensitive files like `.env` (which contains your database password) and the massive `node_modules/` folder would have been pushed to GitHub.

- `.env` contains secrets — **never push this to GitHub**
- `node_modules/` contains thousands of files that don't need to be stored — anyone can recreate it by running `npm install`

**Fix:** Created a `.gitignore` file that tells Git to ignore both:
```
node_modules/
.env
```

---

## 7. Added `.env.example` (Git Setup)

**File:** `.env.example` *(newly created)*

**What was wrong:**
Since `.env` is now ignored by Git, anyone who clones the project won't know what environment variables are needed to run it.

**Fix:** Created `.env.example` with placeholder values so others know exactly what to fill in:
```
PORT=5050
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/<dbname>?appName=Cluster0
```

---

## 8. Fixed `package.json`

**File:** `package.json`

**What was wrong:**
- `"main"` was pointing to `index.js` which doesn't exist. The real entry file is `server.js`.
- There were no `start` or `dev` scripts, so you had to manually type `node server.js` or `npx nodemon server.js` every time.

**Fix:**
```json
"main": "server.js",
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```
Now you can just run:
- `npm start` → runs the app normally
- `npm run dev` → runs with nodemon (auto-restarts on file changes)

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your real values
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

---

## 9. CSRF Vulnerability Fixed with JWT Auth (High Severity)

**Files affected:** `routes/eventRoutes.js`, `middleware/auth.js` *(newly created)*

### What is CSRF?

CSRF stands for **Cross-Site Request Forgery**. It's an attack where a malicious website tricks a logged-in user's browser into making unwanted requests to your API — like booking or cancelling tickets without the user knowing.

Example: You're logged into the ticketing app. You visit a shady website. That website secretly sends a POST request to `/api/events/:id/book` using your browser. Without protection, the API has no way to tell it wasn't you.

### Why were the POST and PUT routes vulnerable?

The routes for creating events, booking tickets, and cancelling tickets had no protection at all — anyone could call them:
```js
router.post("/", createEvent);           // no protection
router.post("/:id/book", bookTicket);    // no protection
router.put("/ticket/:id/cancel", cancelTicket); // no protection
```

### How it was fixed — JWT Authentication

Since this is a REST API (not a browser app with cookies/sessions), the best fix is **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication.

Here's how it works:
1. When a user logs in, the server gives them a **token** — a long encrypted string
2. For every sensitive request, the user must send that token in the request header
3. The server checks the token before allowing the action

A browser-based CSRF attack **cannot** attach this token because it lives in JavaScript memory, not in cookies.

**New file created — `middleware/auth.js`:**
```js
const protect = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "No token, authorization denied" });
  }
  const token = authHeader.split(" ")[1];
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next(); // token is valid, continue to the route
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Token is not valid" });
  }
};
```

**Routes updated to use the `protect` middleware:**
```js
router.post("/", protect, createEvent);
router.post("/:id/book", protect, bookTicket);
router.put("/ticket/:id/cancel", protect, cancelTicket);
```

The `protect` middleware sits between the route and the controller — it checks the token first, and only lets the request through if it's valid.

### What was added to `.env`

A new secret key was added:
```
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
```
This is the key used to sign and verify tokens. Keep it secret — never push it to GitHub.

### How to test a protected route

Add this header to your API request (e.g. in Postman):
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```
Without it, the server will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.

---

## 10. Added User Register & Login (Auth System)

**New files:** `models/User.js`, `controllers/authController.js`, `routes/authRoutes.js`

### Why do we need this?

Earlier we added JWT protection to routes, but there was no way to actually *get* a token. It was like putting a lock on a door but never giving anyone a key.

Now we have two new routes:
- `POST /api/auth/register` — create a new account, get a token back
- `POST /api/auth/login` — log in with email + password, get a token back

### What is bcryptjs?

Storing passwords as plain text is dangerous. If your database gets hacked, everyone's password is exposed.

`bcryptjs` **hashes** the password — it converts it into a scrambled string that can't be reversed. When a user logs in, we hash what they typed and compare it to the stored hash.

Example:
```
Plain:  password123
Hashed: $2a$10$Xk9z....(unreadable)
```

### How the User model works (`models/User.js`)

- Stores `name`, `email`, `password`
- Before saving, automatically hashes the password using a `pre("save")` hook
- Has a `matchPassword()` method to compare passwords at login

### How the auth controller works (`controllers/authController.js`)

**Register:**
1. Check if email already exists
2. Create the user (password gets auto-hashed by the model)
3. Return a JWT token

**Login:**
1. Find user by email
2. Compare entered password with stored hash
3. If match, return a JWT token

### The token expires in 7 days

```js
jwt.sign({ id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: "7d" })
```
After 7 days the token stops working and the user needs to log in again.

## 11. Added Swagger UI

**New files:** `config/swagger.js`
**Updated:** `app.js`
**Packages installed:** `swagger-ui-express`, `swagger-jsdoc`

### What is Swagger UI?

Swagger UI is a webpage that automatically documents your API and lets you test it directly in the browser — no Postman needed for basic testing.

Once the server is running, visit:
```
http://localhost:5050/api-docs
```

You'll see all your routes listed with descriptions, input fields, and a way to send real requests.

### What is swagger-jsdoc?

Instead of writing a separate documentation file, `swagger-jsdoc` reads special comments (called JSDoc comments) directly above your routes and turns them into documentation automatically.

Example comment above a route:
```js
/**
 * @swagger
 * /api/events:
 *   get:
 *     summary: Get all events
 *     tags: [Events]
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: List of all events
 */
router.get("/", getEvents);
```

### How to use the Authorize button in Swagger

Protected routes show a 🔒 lock icon in Swagger UI. To test them:

1. First call `POST /api/auth/login` in Swagger and copy the token from the response
2. Click the **Authorize** button at the top of the Swagger page
3. Type `Bearer <your_token>` and click Authorize
4. Now all protected routes will automatically send your token

### How the bearerAuth security scheme works (`config/swagger.js`)

This tells Swagger that the API uses JWT tokens sent in the `Authorization` header:
```js
securitySchemes: {
  bearerAuth: {
    type: "http",
    scheme: "bearer",
    bearerFormat: "JWT"
  }
}
```
Any route with `security: [{ bearerAuth: [] }]` in its comment will show the 🔒 lock icon.

## 12. How to Test with Postman

### Setup — Create an Environment

1. Open Postman → click **Environments** → **New Environment** → name it `EventTicketing`
2. Add a variable called `token` (leave value empty for now)
3. Add a variable called `baseUrl` with value `http://localhost:5050`
4. Select this environment from the top-right dropdown

### Step 1 — Register a user

- Method: `POST`
- URL: `{{baseUrl}}/api/auth/register`
- Body (JSON):
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```
Copy the `token` from the response.

### Step 2 — Auto-save the token (Tests tab trick)

In the **Tests** tab of your register/login request, paste this:
```js
pm.environment.set("token", pm.response.json().token);
```
Now every time you register or login, Postman automatically saves the token to your environment.

### Step 3 — Use the token on protected routes

For any protected route (create event, book ticket, cancel ticket):
- Go to the **Authorization** tab
- Type: `Bearer`
- Token: `{{token}}`

Or set it globally on the Collection → Authorization tab so all requests inherit it.

### Step 4 — Test the routes in order

| Step | Method | URL | Auth needed |
|------|--------|-----|-------------|
| Register | POST | `{{baseUrl}}/api/auth/register` | No |
| Login | POST | `{{baseUrl}}/api/auth/login` | No |
| Create Event | POST | `{{baseUrl}}/api/events` | Yes |
| Get Events | GET | `{{baseUrl}}/api/events` | No |
| Book Ticket | POST | `{{baseUrl}}/api/events/:id/book` | Yes |
| Cancel Ticket | PUT | `{{baseUrl}}/api/events/ticket/:id/cancel` | Yes |
| Validate Ticket | GET | `{{baseUrl}}/api/events/ticket/validate/:code` | No |
| Event Stats | GET | `{{baseUrl}}/api/events/:id/stats` | No |

## 13. Fixed "TypeError: next is not a function" (Express 5 Compatibility)

**Files fixed:** `middleware/auth.js`, `controllers/eventController.js`, `controllers/authController.js`

### What was the error?

When hitting a protected route, the app crashed with:
```
TypeError: next is not a function
```

### Why did it happen?

This project uses **Express 5** (the latest version). Express 5 changed how it handles errors in async functions compared to Express 4.

In Express 4, if an async function threw an error and you didn't catch it, the app would just hang or crash silently.

In Express 5, it tries to automatically forward unhandled async errors to the next error handler using `next(err)`. But when the middleware chain wasn't set up with proper async handling, Express got confused about what `next` was — causing the `TypeError`.

Two things were missing:

**1. `protect` middleware wasn't async**

```js
// Before — regular function
const protect = (req, res, next) => { ... };

// After — async function (Express 5 needs this)
const protect = async (req, res, next) => { ... };
```

**2. Controllers had no `try/catch`**

Without `try/catch`, any database error (like a bad ID format) would throw an unhandled promise rejection. Express 5 tries to catch it but needs `next` to be properly passed through.

```js
// Before — no error handling
const createEvent = async (req, res) => {
  await newEvent.save(); // if this fails, app crashes
};

// After — proper error handling
const createEvent = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    await newEvent.save();
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // passes the error to Express's error handler
  }
};
```

### What does `next(err)` do?

`next` is a function Express gives every middleware and route handler. Calling `next(err)` tells Express *"something went wrong, skip to the error handler"*. Express then sends back a `500` response instead of crashing the whole server.

Think of it like a safety net — instead of the app falling over, it catches the error and responds gracefully.
